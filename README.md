# BeeDAQ
Setting up raspi for data aquisition:
Make sure to check the thermacouple's address, steps can be found on group website.
Then check i2c connection location.
install matplotlib

Circuit:
Thermacouple: 3.3V, pin 4, GRND, use resistor
One LED connected to pin 6, use resistor
One LED connected o pin 17, use resistor
Button connected to 3.3V, with one side connecting to pin 21, use resistor
LCD: VCC = 5v+, GRND = GRND, SDA = SDA, SCL = SCL
